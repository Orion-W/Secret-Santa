This project is a Secret Santa program that I made so cover every possible function that could be desired in a Secret Santa game, this includes using text files to keep a log of previous years allowing the 
user to make sure that people cannot get the same assignments as before, creating text files for each participant that includes thier assignment, a team function that ensures participants only are assigned 
people on different teams, and functions that allow the user to ensure or disallow some assignments. 

I'm proud of the object oriented programing in this project.
